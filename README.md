##Description
What is Automated Report Generation?
Automated Report Generation refers to the process of automatically creating structured reports using data from various sources without manual effort. In this project, we used Python to collect, process, and generate reports in formats like PDF.
The main goal is to reduce human effort, save time, and generate consistent, professional reports based on real-time or stored data.

What We Did:
Collected Data
Data was entered manually, fetched from a CSV.
Processed the Data.
Cleaned and filtered the data.
Performed average calculation of the marks, sorting, and grouping.
Generated the Report

Used libraries such as:
fpdf to generate PDFs.
Summary like average of the student's marks are calculated into the report.
Saved or Exported Report.
Saved the final report as a PDF.

Tools & Libraries Used:
1)Python
2)FPDF 
3)Collection

Outcome:
The result is a professional, auto-generated report that includes data summaries and insights — all created with minimal manual input. This is useful for business analytics, weekly/monthly summaries, calculating percentage of different students and data-driven decision-making.

Platform Used :- Visual Studio Code
